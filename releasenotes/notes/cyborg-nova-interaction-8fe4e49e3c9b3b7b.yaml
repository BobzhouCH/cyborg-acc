    Cyborg-Nova interaction was completed in Queens via three specs.
    The cyborg-nova-interaction spec serves as the main spec defines the interaction
    mechanism between Cyborg and Nova is via Placement to which cyborg-conductor
    will periodically report the accelerator resource info, which is acquired via
    resource tracker functionality in the agent.
    The cyborg-internal-api spec defines the internal api that is mainly used for
    internal communication between conductor/agent and driver.
    The cyborg-fpga-model-proposal spec defines the first tryout of data modeling of
    accelerator resources via resource provider. Two types of tables (accelerator
    for base PF and deployable for VF) are defined there and nested resource
    provider will be utilized in Rocky release.
