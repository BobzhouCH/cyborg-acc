    The cyborg framework consists of three core services - API, Conductor
    and Agent.
    cyborg-api supports GET/POST/PUT/DELETE operations for accelerators.
    cyborg-conductor is responsible for handling all API requests that come in
    via the API service.
    cyborg-agent is responsible for all the Nova Cyborg interaction.
    It should be noted that for operations that are not associated with DB change,
    the cyborg-api could directly call cyborg-agent.
