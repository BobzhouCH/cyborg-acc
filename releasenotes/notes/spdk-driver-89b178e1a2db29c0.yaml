    The cyborg-spdk-driver-proposal spec defines the first software accelerator
    driver managed by Cyborg. SPDK is widely used in NVMe SSD user space driver
    to have a high performance. In Queens only basic operations on SPDK (discover,
    list, construct/delete subsystem for NVMeOF devices, add/delete ip address
    for vhost) are supported, more completed operation support should be expected
    in the next couple releases.
