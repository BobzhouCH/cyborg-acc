    The cyborg-fpga-driver-proposal spec provides the first proposal of a cyborg
    fpga driver. Two operations are supported - discover and program, although the
    latter was not finished in Queens and will be in Rocky. The code implementation
    starts with an Intel QAT card, but more vendor card support should be
    added later and the driver support should be generalized.
