Introduction
============

Background Story
----------------

OpenStack Acceleration  Discussion Started from Telco Requirements:

* High level requirements first drafted in the standard organization ETSI NFV ISG
* High level requirements transformed into detailed requirements in OPNFV DPACC project.
* New project called Nomad established to address the requirements.
* BoF discussions back in OpenStack Austin Summit.

Transition to Cyborg Project:

* From a long period of conversation and discussion within the OpenStack community,
we found that the initial goal of Nomad project to address acceleration management
in Telco is too limited. From design summit session in Barcelona Summit, we have
developers from Scientific WG help us understanding the need for acceleration management
in HPC cloud, and we also had a lot of discussion on the Public Cloud support of
accelerated instances.

* We decide to formally establish a project that will work on the management framework
for dedicated devices in OpenStack, and there comes the Cyborg Project.
